5. What is the name of the file that defaced the imreallynotbatman.com website? Please submit only the name of the file with the extension (For example, "notepad.exe" or "favicon.ico").

I had a lot of trouble with this question. But one thing to pay attention to is that instead of we search in the usual way (dest_ip is the address of our website), here we need to do the opposite. If this is new knowledge, can you write it in your own notes?

Why do we need to do the opposite? That's because the defaced action of the website is done after the attacker takes control of our server. And in more detail, it will be an action to download files from outside. So the query will originate from the outbound server.

```

Great, we have 76 events here. Somehow we have to filter and collapse the results. The first thing that came to my attention was the EventID, and EventID 1 is a very nice compact step. According to Microsoft Sysmon, EventID=1 means creating a process. That means when the file is uploaded to the server, launching it will create a new process.

Finally, filtering the results by CommandLine="3791.exe" will give the final result.
