Hello, today is not a very special day, but because I have free time, I want to write a small writeup for FIA's CTF event (FPT Information Assurance).

For those who are new to CTF and especially in the field of RE (Reverse Engineering), this is quite a difficult challenge, requiring the player's patience and understanding of the code at a basic level. Ok, let's get started.

First, I downloaded the 264.zip folder and extracted it into a 264 folder with the following subfiles.

With the ***file*** command, I already know that here we have a ELF 64-bit (Executable and Linkable Format) file that is executed on a Linux environment. There are also 3 other image files.

First we'll run ***link*** to see what happens to it.

A message is printed to the console ***"We are missing something important"***. This is a good suggestion, and we're really missing something. But what are we missing here? We downloaded the 264.zip folder, then extracted it and there were no problems. So it can only be speculated that the issuer has deleted a certain detail, the task we will need to find that thing.

Now I will use Ghidra, a useful tool in decompiled from Assembly language to C language.

Luckily I could immediately find the main() function. But the unfortunate thing here is that we have too many variables and parameters with default names. To make the analysis easier I am going to tweak this code a bit.

Here, the ***flag*** variable is specified for reading ***flag.txt*** file. Right below is checking if ***flag*** is zero or not. And the results are still the same as when we first tested. So it's conceivable that what's lost here is the flag.txt file.

The same thing happens with the baolong.jpg file. If you remove the presence of the baolong.jpg file, I'm pretty sure you'll get the same message as in the code.

The difference here is that instead of reading the content, our 3 image files will be opened and append the content to the end of the file. This is an important point that we need to keep in mind, it will be the strongest hint leading to finding the final flag.

***Note:*** To make it easier to imagine, in the scope of the article I will use the index instead of the ordinal number in the array.

Here, the contents of flag.txt are stored in the variable *var_flag*. The 35th line of code tells us it reads 0x1e (30) characters from the file flag.txt. The 31st and 33rd lines of code, *var_log[1]* and *var_log[2]* are added to chikhang. On the 32nd line, the variable *var_log[0]* is added 0x15 (21) before being added to andang. *local_6b* is currently holding *var_log[3]* in line 34 of code.

Immediately below, *local_33* and *local_34* hold the contents of *var_log[4]* and *var_log[5]*. Although Ghidra doesn't show it, I also don't want to dig into the stack and the like so here if you are new you can skip it, but if you want to find out, try reading Assembly code and see for yourself.

In the first for loop (from lines 37 to 40), the variables *var_log[i]* with the rule i between 6 and less than 0x1f (31), each incremented by 3 units, are added to baolong in turn. That is, we will have a set of: *var_log[6], var_log[9], var_log[12], etc.* Also here increment *local_6b* variable after each iteration. Try to calculate what is the value of the *local_6b* variable (*var_log[3]*) after stopping the loop?

Same goes for the other 2 loops.

Now all the secrets are revealed. All algorithms have been revealed. I will leave the rest to you to learn the contents of the flag. My suggestion is that you should use the ***tail*** command to get the last characters, then arrange them in the correct position. Good luck and thanks for reading this far.
