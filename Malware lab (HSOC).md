2.5. Có thời điểm nào mà log trong hệ thống bị xóa không? Nếu có, các sự kiện xóa log này được

When I looked up the facts regarding log deletion in Event Viewer, [EventID1102](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-1102) was the event that struck me really dig deep and have doubtful thoughts about it. However, in the search results on the machine, this event is not recorded at all. but dear abnr still has many doubts because of the feeling that something is still missing. That stems from the fact that the number of events coming from ApplicationLog and SecurityLog has a huge difference (104 vs. 9194). This raised my suspicions about the attacker's Log delete event.
But here the question is if the attacker deletes the Log, where is the event located. I decided instead of filtering by EventID to do a filter by the date of the attack (September 14, 2021). Scan through a turn of Logs, at SystemLog, specifically EventID104, encountered Log clear. And filtering from that leads to 3 other similar events, 3 of which are Sysmon's Log clear, and the other are Application Log's.

In the process of searching for more information, I found the following articles, I hope they will help you:

After doing a scan with the loki tool, I have the following preliminary evidence of the attacker's behavior:

In addition to the files above, there are other signs discovered that need further investigation. From the above evidence I believe that the attacker used CobaltStrike.
